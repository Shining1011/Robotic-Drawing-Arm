This is the code for the prototype for a robotic arm that is able to draw on a piece of paper. This prototype has the two motors set up in an arm configuration that track the position of your mouse on the screen.

This prototype is a proof of concept before moving onto an actual working device.

this project prototype uses:
- Arduino Due;
- Micro Servo x 2
- Pencil x 2
- Bread Board
- 5.5V power supply
- Jumper Cables
- USB to UBS-micro cable

The arduino code can be found in Arduino_Due/src/main.cpp
The python code can be found in Python/Inverse _Kinematics_Test.py
